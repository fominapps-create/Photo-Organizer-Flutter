# Privacy Policy for Filtored (Photo Organizer)

Last updated: December 29, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Filtored (the "App") handles your data. The App processes photos locally on your device and, if you choose to enable it, may send copies of selected photos to a server you configure for AI-based tagging.

## What Data We Collect
- Photos you select for organization or enhanced analysis
- Basic derived metadata (e.g., tags/categories generated by AI)
- Non-sensitive diagnostic logs (e.g., network status, error messages)

We do not collect contacts, messages, or precise location data.

## How Data Is Processed
- On‑device: The App performs basic organization and preview tagging locally.
- Optional server processing: If you enable server uploads, the App sends selected photos to your configured server for enhanced AI analysis (e.g., object/category detection). The App includes the photo and a `photoID` in the request. You control the server URL in Settings.

## Storage & Retention
- On‑device: Organized photos and tags are stored locally. Deleted items go to Trash and can be restored.
- Server: If you enable server processing, copies of photos you upload may be temporarily stored and processed on that server. Storage and retention on that server depend on how you operate it. We do not operate or control third‑party or self‑hosted servers.

## Data Sharing
- The App does not share your data with third parties by default.
- If you enable server uploads, data is shared with the server you configure. You should review and trust the server you use.

## User Controls
- Consent: The App asks for your permission before the first server upload.
- Permissions: The App requests photo library access to read and organize photos.
- Trash & Restore: Deleted photos are managed via the Trash screen with restore options.
- Disable Server Uploads: You can disable server processing by clearing or not setting the server URL.

## Security
- Network requests to your server are sent over HTTP by default for local networks. If you use a remote server, configure HTTPS to help protect data in transit.

## Children’s Privacy
The App is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes
We may update this policy to reflect improvements. Material changes will be reflected by updating the date above.

## Contact
For questions or requests, please contact the developer via the app’s store listing contact details.
